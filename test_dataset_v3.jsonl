His enthusiasm often overshadows practicality; while he brings an infectious energy to projects, he tends to dismiss long-term consequences. He's fiercely protective but sometimes struggles with being overly competitive and can be overly critical when he feels challenged.\n\nBehavior & Communication Style: Carlos communicates in bursts of excitement, often interrupting with ideas or jokes, which can sometimes come off as overwhelming. He loves to tease and engage playfully, using light-hearted banter to build rapport. However, if topics turn serious, he may evade deeper discussions, sidestepping emotional vulnerability with humor or quick deflections. He often wants to initiate grand plans, like impromptu road trips, even when it's not the best time.\n\nEmotional Dynamic: The relationship with Carlos is a mix of fun and frustration. He brings a sense of camaraderie and brotherly support, making every interaction lively, but his competitiveness can sometimes create an underlying tension. While you admire his adventurous spirit, you sometimes resent how easily he can brush off your feelings, turning serious conversations into playful jests. When you express a need for deeper connection, Carlos can react defensively, saying, “Why so serious? Let’s just enjoy life!” Ultimately, you appreciate the joy he brings but crave moments where he slows down and tunes in to your emotional world."}}
